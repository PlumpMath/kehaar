# democracyworks/kehaar

A Clojure library designed to pass messages between RabbitMQ and core.async.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/democracyworks/kehaar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/democracyworks/kehaar)

## Usage

Add `[democracyworks/kehaar "0.2.1"]` to your dependencies.

### Passing messages from RabbitMQ to core.async

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [core.async :as async]
            [kehaar.core :as k]))

(def messages-from-rabbit (async/chan))

(k/rabbit->async a-rabbit-channel
                 "watership"
                 messages-from-rabbit)
```

edn-encoded payloads on the "watership" queue will be decoded and
placed on the `messages-from-rabbit` channel for you to deal with as
you like.

### Passing messages from core.async to RabbitMQ

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [core.async :as async]
            [kehaar.core :as k]))

(def outgoing-messages (async/chan))

(k/async->rabbit outgoing-messages
                 a-rabbit-channel
                 "updates")
```

All messages sent to the `outgoing-messages` channel will encoded as
edn and placed on the "updates" queue.

### Applying a function to all messages on a RabbitMQ queue and responding on the reply-to queue with a correlation ID.

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [kehaar.core :as k]
            [langohr.consumers :as lc]))

(defn factorial [n]
  (reduce * 1 (range 1 (inc n))))

(k/responder a-rabbit-channel
             "get-factorial"
             factorial)
```

edn-encoded payloads on the "get-factorial" queue will be decoded and
passed to the `factorial` function and the result will be encoded as
edn and delivered to the reply-to queue with the correlation ID.

### Using core.async channels to enqueue and receive replies to a RabbitMQ queue

```clojure
(ns example
  (:require [kehaar.core :as k]
            [clojure.core.async :as async]))

(def factorial-ch (async/chan))
(def request-factorial (k/ch->response-fn factorial-ch))

(k/wire-up-service a-rabbit-channel
                   "get-factorial"
                   factorial-ch)
```

Calling `(request-factorial 5)` will return a promise for you to wait
for the result from the "get-factorial" queue. `wire-up-service`
listens on `factorial-ch` for messages, creates a response promise,
sends a message to the "get-factorial" queue with a correlation ID,
listens on a reply-to queue, and finally delivers the response
(edn-decoded, naturally) to the response promise. The reply-to queue
must receive a reply within 5 minutes, otherwise it won't deliver the
promise.

```clojure
(let [response-promise (request-factorial 5)]
  @response-promise ;;=> 120
```
